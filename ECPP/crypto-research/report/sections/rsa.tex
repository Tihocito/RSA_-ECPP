\section{RSA with Provable Primes}

Prime numbers are first generated using Miller--Rabin for efficiency.
Each candidate prime is then verified using ECPP to obtain a primality
certificate.

The RSA modulus $n = pq$ is constructed using these verified primes.
The certificates can be stored alongside the private key and used for
independent verification.
