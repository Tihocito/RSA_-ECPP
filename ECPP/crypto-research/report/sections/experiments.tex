\section{Experiments}

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the correctness and performance of the
system.

\subsection{Correctness}
All generated RSA keys successfully passed encryption, decryption, and digital
signature tests.

\subsection{Performance}
While ECPP is significantly slower than Miller--Rabin, it is used only as an
offline verification step. The overall overhead is acceptable for high-security
applications.
