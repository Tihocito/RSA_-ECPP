\section{Background}

\subsection{RSA Cryptosystem}
RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring a large composite integer
$n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are large primes.

\subsection{Primality Testing}
Probabilistic tests such as Miller--Rabin are fast and widely used, but they do
not provide absolute certainty. Deterministic tests are desirable in
high-assurance systems.

\subsection{Elliptic Curves}
Elliptic curves over finite fields provide rich algebraic structures that can be
used to design efficient primality proving algorithms.
