\section{Introduction}

Public-key cryptography relies heavily on the hardness of integer
factorization. RSA remains one of the most widely deployed cryptosystems.
A critical requirement of RSA is the generation of large prime numbers.

In practice, probabilistic primality tests such as Miller--Rabin are commonly
used. While efficient, these tests only provide probabilistic guarantees.
Elliptic Curve Primality Proving (ECPP) offers a deterministic alternative by
producing a certificate that can be independently verified.

This work implements an RSA cryptosystem whose prime factors are verified using
ECPP, thereby providing provable security guarantees.
