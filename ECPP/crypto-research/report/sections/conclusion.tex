\section{Conclusion}

This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating ECPP into RSA key
generation to obtain provable primes. The resulting system provides stronger
security guarantees than conventional RSA implementations.

Future work includes optimizing ECPP for large integers, implementing full
Atkin--Morain ECPP, and extending the system to other cryptographic primitives.
