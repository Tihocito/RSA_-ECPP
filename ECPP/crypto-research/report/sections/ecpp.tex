\section{Elliptic Curve Primality Proving}

ECPP is a deterministic algorithm that proves the primality of an integer by
constructing elliptic curves over finite fields and verifying group order
properties.

Given an integer $n$, ECPP attempts to find an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Z}_n$
such that the order of the group $E(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ satisfies certain
factorization properties. If these properties hold and a large prime factor is
recursively proven prime, then $n$ is prime.

Unlike probabilistic tests, ECPP produces a certificate that can be independently
verified.
